            <h2>Who I Am</h2>
            <p>
                Hi, I’m Harsh, also known as <strong>Drago</strong>.
                I’m a passionate <strong>Full Stack Web Developer</strong> who enjoys turning ideas into
                functional, clean, and user-friendly websites.

            <h2>My Tech Journey</h2>
            <p>
                I started my coding journey with <strong>Python</strong>, creating small automation scripts
                and fun projects. Over time, I expanded into <strong>HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript</strong> to
                bring my ideas to life on the web.
                Today, I combine these skills to build projects ranging from <strong>e-commerce websites</strong>
                and <strong>blog pages</strong> to tools like <strong>scrapers</strong> and <strong>crypto-related
                    apps</strong>.
            </p>

            <h2>My Philosophy</h2>
            <p>
                I believe in writing code that is not only functional but also clean and maintainable.
                For me, development is about solving problems creatively and making technology accessible
                to everyone.
            </p>

            <h2>What’s Next?</h2>
            <p>
                I’m continuously learning and currently sharpening my <strong>JavaScript</strong> and
                exploring backend frameworks to move deeper into full-stack development.
                My goal is to work on impactful projects that merge creativity, technology, and real-world
                problem-solving.
